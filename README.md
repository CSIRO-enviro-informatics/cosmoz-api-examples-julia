# Examples of interacting with CosmOZ API
## Julia Edition

All examples are written in Julia 1.0, and should be compatible with Julia versions 1.0, 1.1, and 1.2.

* _Note_: Due to the lack of a good native plotting package for Julia, the plotting demo is omitted from this example set.

###Requirements:
These examples are written using Julia standard libraries wherever possible.

* HTTP package is required for making HTTP Client requests
* JSON package is required for parsing the JSON responses from the REST API
* Printf package is required for outputting simple text to the console for example purposes

###Constants:
These examples use constants (in UPPERCASE) at the top of each example file to simplify and direct the examples,
for example the Site Number and the Data Processing Level. Feel free to change these constants to customise
these examples.
